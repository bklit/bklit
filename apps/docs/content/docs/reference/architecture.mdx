# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of Bklit's architecture and how components work together.

## System Architecture

Bklit is built as a modern, scalable analytics platform with the following architecture:

### Frontend Applications

- **Dashboard** - Next.js app for viewing analytics
- **Website** - Marketing site
- **Playground** - SDK testing app
- **Docs** - Documentation site

### Backend Services

- **API Layer** - tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Analytics Service** - ClickHouse for analytics data
- **Database** - PostgreSQL for application data
- **Auth Service** - Better Auth for authentication

### Data Flow

1. **SDK** connects to WebSocket server (wss://bklit.ws)
2. **WebSocket Server** validates tokens and enriches with geolocation
3. **Events queued** in Redis for reliable processing
4. **Worker** processes queue in batches and stores in ClickHouse
5. **WebSocket broadcasts** events instantly to connected dashboards
6. **Dashboard** receives real-time updates (under 1 second latency)

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components

### Backend

- tRPC for APIs
- Prisma for database
- Better Auth for authentication
- ClickHouse for analytics

### Infrastructure

- PostgreSQL database
- ClickHouse for analytics
- Resend for email
- Polar.sh for billing

## Monorepo Structure

See [Monorepo Structure](/reference/monorepo-structure) for detailed structure.

## Data Storage

### PostgreSQL

Stores:
- Users and authentication
- Organizations and projects
- API tokens
- Event definitions
- Funnels

### ClickHouse

Stores:
- Page view events
- Custom events
- Session data
- Analytics aggregates

## Authentication Flow

1. User signs in with GitHub/Google
2. Better Auth handles OAuth
3. Session created and stored
4. Protected routes check session
5. tRPC procedures verify authentication

## Analytics Flow (WebSocket Architecture)

Bklit uses WebSocket architecture for instant real-time analytics:

### Event Tracking
1. SDK establishes WebSocket connection to wss://bklit.ws
2. Events sent over persistent connection (pageviews, custom events)
3. Token validation with Redis caching
4. IP geolocation via ip-api.com
5. Events queued in Redis for processing
6. Instant broadcast to connected dashboards

### Background Processing
1. Worker polls Redis queue every 1 second
2. Pops up to 100 events in batch
3. Looks up EventDefinition UUIDs from Postgres (cached)
4. Creates/updates sessions in ClickHouse
5. Batch inserts events to ClickHouse
6. Publishes to Redis pub/sub for real-time updates

### Real-time Updates
1. Worker publishes processed events to Redis
2. WebSocket server subscribes to Redis channel
3. Broadcasts to connected dashboard clients
4. Dashboard UI updates instantly

### Benefits
- **100x faster** ClickHouse writes (batch vs single inserts)
- **Zero data loss** - Redis queue with AOF persistence
- **Scalable** - Add more workers for higher throughput
- **Observable** - /terminal UI shows complete pipeline

## Billing Flow

1. User upgrades via Polar checkout
2. Polar webhook received
3. Organization plan updated
4. Features enabled/disabled
5. Usage limits adjusted
