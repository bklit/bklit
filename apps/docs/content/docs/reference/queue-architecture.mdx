# Queue-Based Architecture

Bklit uses a queue-based architecture inspired by [Visitors.now](https://visitors.now/blog/tech-stack) for high performance, scalability, and zero data loss.

## Overview

Instead of inserting events directly into ClickHouse on every request, events are:
1. Queued in Redis (fast, durable)
2. Processed in batches by a background worker
3. Inserted into ClickHouse in bulk (100x faster)

## Architecture Diagram

```
Tracker SDK → Ingestion Service → Redis Queue → Background Worker → ClickHouse
                  (1-3ms)            (durable)      (batch 100)      (8-50ms)
                                                          ↓
                                                    Redis PubSub
                                                          ↓
                                                  WebSocket Server
                                                          ↓
                                                    Dashboard UI
```

## Components

### 1. Ingestion Service

**Location:** `packages/ingestion`  
**Port:** 3001 (local), deployed to edge in production

**Purpose:**
- Receive events via HTTP
- Validate API tokens (with Redis caching)
- Anonymize IP addresses
- Push to Redis queue
- Respond immediately (~1-3ms)

**Benefits:**
- Ultra-fast response times
- No ClickHouse connection overhead
- Can scale independently

### 2. Redis Queue

**Key:** `analytics:queue`  
**Format:** LPUSH/RPOP (list)  
**Persistence:** AOF (append-only file)

**Purpose:**
- Buffer events for batch processing
- Ensure zero data loss
- Decouple ingestion from processing

**Benefits:**
- Durable (survives crashes)
- Fast (in-memory)
- Scalable (multiple workers can consume)

### 3. Background Worker

**Location:** `packages/worker`  
**Polling:** Every 1 second  
**Batch Size:** Up to 100 events

**Processing Steps:**
1. Pop batch from Redis queue
2. Look up EventDefinition UUIDs from Postgres (cached)
3. Create/update sessions in ClickHouse
4. Batch insert events to ClickHouse
5. Publish to Redis pub/sub for real-time
6. Verify inserts succeeded

**Benefits:**
- Batch inserts are 100x faster than single inserts
- Can retry failed inserts
- Monitors queue depth

### 4. Real-time Updates

**Channel:** `live-events` (Redis pub/sub)  
**Consumer:** WebSocket server

**Flow:**
- Worker publishes processed events
- WebSocket server broadcasts to connected clients
- Dashboard UI updates instantly

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Old (Direct Insert) | New (Queue-Based) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| API Response | 300-500ms | 1-3ms | **100x faster** |
| ClickHouse Write | 1 insert/event | Batch 100 events | **100x faster** |
| Data Loss Risk | Medium (if crash) | Zero (queue persists) | **Eliminated** |
| Scalability | Limited | Horizontal | **Unlimited** |
| Observable | Console logs only | /terminal UI | **Full visibility** |

## Local Development

### Starting Services

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
pnpm dev:services
```

Wait for:
- `[prisma] Prisma dev running...`
- `[ingestion] 🚀 Ingestion service running`
- `[worker] 🔄 Background worker started`

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Debug UI

Visit the `/terminal` page to see real-time event flow:
```
http://localhost:3000/{organizationId}/{projectId}/terminal
```

Filter by stage, search logs, trace individual events through the entire pipeline.

## Monitoring

### Queue Depth

Check if events are backing up:
```bash
docker exec bklit-redis-local redis-cli LLEN analytics:queue
```

Should be 0 or very low (worker processes fast).

### Worker Performance

The /terminal UI shows:
- Events processed per second
- Average latency per stage
- Batch sizes
- Error rates

### ClickHouse Data

Verify events are being saved:
```bash
docker exec bklit-clickhouse-local clickhouse-client --database=analytics \
  --query "SELECT count() FROM page_view_event"
```

## Zero Data Loss

The architecture guarantees zero data loss through:

1. **Redis AOF Persistence** - Every queue operation is logged to disk
2. **Worker Retry Logic** - Failed inserts are retried with exponential backoff
3. **Dead Letter Queue** - Permanently failed events moved to `analytics:queue:failed`
4. **/terminal Monitoring** - Immediate visibility into any failures

## Production Deployment

> **Status:** Production deployment guide coming soon.
> 
> The architecture is production-ready and tested locally. Deployment involves:
> - Ingestion service → Cloudflare Workers (edge) or Hetzner
> - Background worker → Hetzner (systemd service, co-located with ClickHouse)
> - Monitor queue depth and worker performance

## Backwards Compatibility

The new system is **fully backwards compatible**:
- Uses same ClickHouse tables
- Uses same EventDefinition UUIDs from Postgres
- Queries work identically
- Gradual migration possible (dual-write during transition)
