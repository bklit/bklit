# Whitelisting

Whitelisting allows specific accounts to bypass usage limits without being super admin.

## What is Whitelisting?

Whitelisting grants special access to:
- Bypass event limits
- Access all features
- No plan restrictions
- Similar to super admin but organization-specific

## How It Works

### Organization-Level

Whitelisting is checked at the organization level:
- If any organization owner is super admin
- Organization gets unlimited access
- All limits are bypassed

### Usage Limit Check

```typescript
// Check if organization has super admin owner
const hasSuperAdmin = organization.members.some(
  (member) => 
    member.role === 'owner' && 
    member.user.role === 'super_admin'
);

if (hasSuperAdmin) {
  return { allowed: true, limit: Infinity };
}
```

## Whitelisting Methods

### Method 1: Super Admin Owner

Make organization owner a super admin:

```sql
-- Set user as super admin
UPDATE "user" 
SET role = 'super_admin' 
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Method 2: Database Flag

Add whitelist flag to organization (if implemented):

```sql
UPDATE "organization" 
SET whitelisted = true 
WHERE id = 'org-id';
```
