# Real-Time Analytics

Bklit includes real-time features that update your dashboard instantly as visitors interact with your site.

## What You Get

### Live Visitor Notifications

Get notified the moment someone visits your site. Toast notifications appear within 1 second showing:
- Visitor's location (country and city)
- Device type (mobile or desktop)
- Entry page

### Live Map Updates

The globe on your Live analytics page updates instantly when visitors arrive. Watch pins appear in real-time showing exactly where your visitors are from.

### Accurate Live Counts

The live visitor counter in your dashboard header updates immediately. No more stale numbers - you always know exactly how many people are on your site right now.

## How It Works

Real-time analytics uses WebSocket connections to push updates from your server to your dashboard instantly. When a visitor arrives:

1. Event is tracked normally (saved to ClickHouse)
2. Event is also published to Redis
3. WebSocket server broadcasts to connected dashboards
4. You see the update in less than 1 second

### Automatic Fallback

If real-time isn't available (Redis not configured or WebSocket down), everything automatically falls back to polling mode. Your analytics continue working normally - you just won't get instant updates.

## Self-Hosted Setup

Real-time features are **completely optional**. If you don't configure Redis:
- Analytics work exactly as before
- Polling mode (30-60 second updates)
- No errors or degraded functionality

To enable real-time on your self-hosted instance, see our [deployment guide](/docs/deployment/realtime-setup).

## What's Different

**Before (Polling):**
- Updates every 15-30 seconds
- Multiple ClickHouse queries per user
- Slight delays in live counts

**Now (Real-Time):**
- Updates within 1 second
- Fewer database queries
- Instant, accurate live data

The best part? You don't need to do anything - it works automatically in production!
