# Usage Tracking

Bklit tracks usage to enforce plan limits and provide usage insights.

## What is Tracked

### Events

Every analytics event counts toward your monthly limit:

- **Page views** - Each page view is 1 event
- **Custom events** - Each custom event is 1 event
- **Session starts** - Each new session is 1 event
- **All tracked interactions** - Any event sent to Bklit

### Monthly Reset

Usage resets at the start of each calendar month:
- Count starts at 0 on the 1st
- Previous month's usage is archived
- New month begins fresh count

## How Limits Are Enforced

### Event Limit Check

On each event tracking request:

1. **Check current usage** - Count events this month
2. **Check plan limit** - Get limit for current plan
3. **Verify access** - Check if super admin (bypass)
4. **Allow or reject** - Based on limit

### Limit Enforcement

**Free Plan (4,000 events/month):**
- Events tracked until limit reached
- Additional events rejected with error
- Dashboard shows limit warning

**Pro Plan (100,000 events/month):**
- Events tracked until base limit reached
- Additional events billed at $0.0004 per event
- No hard limit - usage-based billing applies

**Super Admin:**
- All limits bypassed
- Unlimited events
- No enforcement checks

## Usage Calculation

### Counting Events

Events are counted per organization:
- All projects in organization count together
- Events across all projects are summed
- Monthly total is tracked

### Example

Organization with 2 projects:
- Project A: 2,000 events
- Project B: 1,500 events
- **Total: 3,500 events** (counted together)

## Development Mode

### Bypass in Development

When `NODE_ENV=development`:
- Limits are bypassed
- All events are allowed
- No enforcement checks
- Useful for testing

### Production Enforcement

In production:
- Limits are strictly enforced
- No bypasses (except super admin)
- Real-time limit checking

## Usage Monitoring

### Dashboard Indicators

View usage in dashboard:
- Current month's events
- Remaining event quota
- Percentage of limit used
- Days until reset

### Usage Warnings

Warnings appear when:
- **80% of limit** - Yellow warning
- **90% of limit** - Orange warning
- **100% of limit** - Red warning, events rejected

### Usage Alerts

Email alerts (if configured):
- Near limit warnings
- Limit reached notifications
- Monthly usage summaries

## Limit Exceeded

### What Happens

When limit is exceeded:
- New events are rejected
- API returns error: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Dashboard shows limit exceeded message
- Upgrade prompt displayed

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "Event limit exceeded",
  "code": "LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "limit": 4000,
  "current": 4001,
  "resetDate": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Resolving
