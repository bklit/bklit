# API Tokens

API tokens are used to authenticate requests to the Bklit Analytics API. Each token is scoped to specific projects and can have domain restrictions for security.

## Overview

API tokens allow you to:
- Track events from your applications
- Send analytics data to Bklit
- Authenticate API requests securely

## Token Format

Tokens follow the format: `bk_live_<64 hex characters>`

Example: `bk_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6`

## Token Security

- Tokens are hashed using scrypt before storage
- Only the token prefix (`bk_live_`) is displayed after creation
- Full tokens are only shown once when created
- Store tokens securely and never commit them to version control
