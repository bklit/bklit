# Testing Connection

After integrating the Bklit SDK, verify that tracking is working correctly.

## Quick Test

### 1. Visit Your Site

Navigate to your website or application where the SDK is installed.

### 2. Check Browser Console

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab.

**With debug mode enabled, you should see:**
```
🎯 Bklit SDK: Initializing with configuration
🆔 Bklit SDK: New session created
🚀 Bklit SDK: Tracking page view...
✅ Bklit SDK: Page view tracked successfully!
```

**Without debug mode:**
- No logs (normal)
- Check Network tab instead

### 3. Check Network Tab

In DevTools Network tab:
- Look for requests to `/api/track`
- Status should be `200 OK`
- Response should be successful

### 4. Check Dashboard

Go to your Bklit dashboard:
1. Navigate to your project
2. Check "Live" or "Sessions" view
3. You should see your session/visit

## Detailed Testing

### Test Page Views

1. Navigate to different pages
2. Check dashboard for page view events
3. Verify page URLs are correct

### Test Sessions

1. Visit your site
2. Wait 30+ minutes
3. Visit again
4. Check for new session created

### Test Custom Events

```javascript
// Track a custom event
window.trackEvent('button-click', 'click', {
  buttonName: 'Sign Up',
  location: 'header'
});
```

Check dashboard for the event.

## Common Issues

### No Events in Dashboard

**Possible causes:**
- SDK not initialized
- Wrong project ID
- Invalid API token
- Token doesn't have project access

**Solutions:**
1. Verify SDK initialization code
2. Check project ID matches dashboard
3. Verify API token is correct
4. Check token project scoping

### Events Delayed

**Normal behavior:**
- Events may take a few seconds to appear
- Batch processing may cause delays
- Refresh dashboard if needed

### Wrong Project Data

**Check:**
- Project ID in SDK matches dashboard
- Token is scoped to correct project
- Domain restrictions allow your domain

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SDK installed correctly
- [ ] SDK initialized on page load
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Network requests successful
- [ ] Page views appear in dashboard
- [ ] Sessions are created
- [ ] Custom events work (if used)

## Using the Playground

The Bklit playground is a demo app for testing SDK integration:

1. Set up playground: [Playground Setup](/docs/playground/setup)
2. Configure with your project ID and token
3. Test tracking in a controlled environment

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```javascript
initBklit({
  projectId: 'your-project-id',
  apiKey: 'your-api-token',
  debug: true, // Enable debug mode
});
```

This shows:
- SDK initialization
- Session creation
- Event tracking
- API requests
- Errors and warnings

## Production Testing

Before going to production:

1. Test in staging environment
2. Verify all events track correctly
3. Check data appears in dashboard
4. Test with real user scenarios
5. Monitor for errors
