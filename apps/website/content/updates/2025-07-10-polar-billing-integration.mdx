I've integrated Polar.sh for billing and subscriptions. This powers the Pro plan with usage-based pricing for events beyond the base allocation.

## Why Polar?

Polar is purpose-built for developer tools and open-source projects. Their webhook-based approach integrates cleanly with Bklit's architecture, and their pricing is transparent and fair.

## How Billing Works

The Pro plan ($10/month) includes:

- 100,000 events per month base
- $0.0004 per event after that
- Automatic overage handling
- No surprise bills (you control the limits)

Polar handles payment processing, invoicing, and subscription management. Webhooks keep Bklit's database in sync with subscription status, so upgrades and downgrades happen instantly.

## Self-Hosted Users

If you're self-hosting, billing is optional. You can remove all Polar-related code and run Bklit without any payment infrastructure. The platform works exactly the same—you just manage your own limits and access control.
