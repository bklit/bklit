I've upgraded Bklit's linting and formatting tooling from Biome to <Mention url="https://ultracite.dev" github="haydenbleasel">Ultracite</Mention>, a newer tool built on top of Biome that adds some helpful features for monorepo projects.

## What Changed?

Ultracite wraps Biome and adds features specifically designed for monorepos like Bklit. It provides better workspace-aware linting, improved configuration merging, and smarter handling of shared configs across packages.

The upgrade was straightforward—I replaced `@biomejs/biome` with `ultracite` in the package.json and updated the lint scripts. All the existing Biome rules and configurations continue to work since Ultracite is built on top of Biome.

## Why Ultracite?

Biome is excellent, but Ultracite adds the missing pieces for monorepo workflows. Since Bklit uses a Turborepo monorepo with 10+ packages, having tooling that understands workspace relationships makes maintenance easier.

The performance is identical to Biome (it's using Biome under the hood), so there's no speed regression. It's purely additive improvements.
