# Real-Time Analytics

We've added real-time features to Bklit that make your analytics feel alive.

## What's New

**Live Visitor Notifications**  
Get notified the moment someone visits your site. You'll see a toast notification within a second showing where they're from and what device they're using. No more waiting around - you know instantly when someone arrives.

**Live Map Updates**  
The globe on your Live page now updates as visitors land on your site. Watch the pins appear in real-time and see exactly where in the world your visitors are coming from.

**Instant Live Counts**  
The live visitor counter in your dashboard header updates immediately. It's accurate, it's fast, and you always know exactly how many people are on your site right now.

## How It Works

We use WebSocket connections to push updates to your dashboard the moment they happen. When someone visits your site, the event travels through Redis pub/sub and gets broadcast to all connected dashboards instantly.

If real-time features aren't available (like if you're self-hosting without Redis), everything automatically falls back to polling mode. Your analytics keep working normally - you just won't get the instant updates.

## What You'll Notice

- Toast notifications pop up within 1 second (they used to take 15-30 seconds)
- Live visitor counts update immediately instead of on a delay
- Map markers appear as visitors arrive, not minutes later
- Everything feels more responsive and alive

## For Self-Hosted Users

Real-time features are completely optional. If you don't set up Redis, Bklit works exactly as it did before. We built it this way so self-hosters don't need extra infrastructure if they don't want it.

If you do want real-time on your self-hosted instance, check out our [deployment guide](/docs/deployment/realtime-setup).

That's it! The feature works automatically in our cloud version. Enjoy the instant updates!
