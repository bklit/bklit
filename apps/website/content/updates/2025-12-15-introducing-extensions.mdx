I'm excited to announce that Bklit now supports extensions! You can now connect your analytics data to external platforms and automate workflows based on custom events.

## What Are Extensions?

Extensions allow you to send your tracked events to third-party services automatically. When a user completes an action you're tracking (like signing up, making a purchase, or clicking a specific button), Bklit can notify your other tools in real-time.

## Available Extensions

I've launched with three extensions:

**Discord** - Send event notifications to Discord channels via webhooks. Perfect for keeping your team updated on important user actions.

**Slack** - Get event notifications in Slack channels. Stay informed without leaving your workspace.

**GitHub** - Create issues automatically based on specific events. Great for bug reports or feature requests triggered by user behavior.

## How It Works

Setting up an extension takes just a few clicks. Navigate to your project settings, choose an extension, configure it with your webhook URL or credentials, and select which events should trigger it. I've built in rate limiting (1,000 events per hour per extension) to prevent spam and keep your notifications meaningful.

Extensions are available on all plans, including the free tier. Head to your dashboard and try them out!
