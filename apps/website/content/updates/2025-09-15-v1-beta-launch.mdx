After months of development, I'm launching Bklit Analytics V1 beta. This is the first public release ready for production use.

## What's Ready?

The beta includes all core features:

- Real-time pageview tracking
- Custom event tracking with metadata
- Session analytics and user journeys
- Geographic tracking (country and city-level)
- Device and browser analytics
- Visual funnel builder
- Team collaboration and workspaces
- API tokens for programmatic access

## What's Next?

The beta period will help identify issues and gather feedback before the official V1.0 release. I'm particularly interested in:

- Performance feedback at scale
- UX improvements for the dashboard
- Missing features or edge cases
- Self-hosting experiences

If you run into any issues or have suggestions, please open a GitHub issue or reach out on Discord. Every piece of feedback helps make Bklit better.
