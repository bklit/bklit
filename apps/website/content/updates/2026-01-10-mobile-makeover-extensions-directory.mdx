Quick update on some website improvements that went live today—mostly polish, but the kind that makes a difference.

## Mobile Menu Gets Better

The mobile navigation now has a cleaner structure with the Product menu showing Overview and Extensions as sub-items. Nothing groundbreaking, just better organization and easier to navigate on your phone.

On desktop, the navigation uses a proper dropdown menu (thanks shadcn) so you can explore without clicking away from the page.

## Extensions Have a Directory

Extensions finally have a proper home at `/extensions`. Instead of just mentioning Discord, Slack, and GitHub in passing, they now get their own directory page with:

- **Search** - Find what you need quickly (⌘K works too)
- **Category filters** - Filter by Notifications, Analytics, etc.
- **Individual pages** - Each extension has setup guides with step-by-step instructions

The layout is inspired by Linear's integrations page—clean sidebar, searchable grid, and detail pages that actually help you get started.

## Under the Hood

The setup guides now use nice numbered steps (instead of markdown headings), code blocks get syntax highlighting, and breadcrumbs help you navigate back. Small things that add up to a better experience.

That's it. Go check out the extensions if you haven't already—they're free on all plans.
