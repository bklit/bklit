I've just shipped the visual funnel builder—one of the most requested features. You can now create conversion funnels with a drag-and-drop interface powered by ReactFlow.

## How It Works

The funnel builder lets you:

- Drag nodes to create funnel steps
- Mix pageview and custom event steps
- See drop-off rates between each step
- Track conversion rates through the entire flow
- Set time limits for campaign tracking

## Why This Matters

Understanding where users drop off in your conversion flow is critical. With the funnel builder, you can quickly identify friction points—whether it's a checkout process, onboarding flow, or feature adoption sequence.

## Technical Implementation

The builder uses ReactFlow for the visual interface, with funnels stored in PostgreSQL and analytics queries running against ClickHouse. When you view a funnel, Bklit calculates conversion rates in real-time based on your selected date range.

All funnel data respects your project permissions, so team members only see funnels for projects they have access to.
