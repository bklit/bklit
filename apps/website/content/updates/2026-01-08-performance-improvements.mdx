We've made significant performance improvements to the Bklit Analytics platform. Here's what changed:

## Database Optimizations

We've optimized our ClickHouse queries to provide faster analytics results:

- **Query Performance**: Up to 3x faster query times for complex analytics
- **Index Improvements**: Better indexing strategies for time-series data
- **Caching Layer**: Implemented smart caching for frequently accessed data

## Frontend Performance

The dashboard now loads faster than ever:

- Reduced initial bundle size by 40%
- Implemented code splitting for better load times
- Optimized React rendering with better memoization

## API Improvements

Our API is now more efficient:

```typescript
// Example of optimized API call
const stats = await fetch('/api/analytics', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ projectId, dateRange })
});
```

These improvements mean you'll see your analytics data faster and with less resource consumption.
