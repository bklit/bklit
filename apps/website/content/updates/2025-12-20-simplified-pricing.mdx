I've simplified Bklit's pricing to make it easier to understand and more accessible for everyone. The new structure has just two tiers: Free and Pro.

## Free Plan

The free plan is perfect for side projects, personal sites, or testing Bklit:

- 4,000 events per month
- 1 project
- 1 team member
- All core analytics features
- API access
- Community support

This gives you plenty of room to track a small to medium-sized website without any cost.

## Pro Plan

For growing businesses and serious projects, the Pro plan offers:

- 100,000 events per month included
- $0.0004 per event after that (usage-based)
- Unlimited projects
- Unlimited team members
- Everything in Free, plus priority support

At $10/month base, it's designed to scale with you. The usage-based pricing means you only pay for what you actually use beyond the base allocation.

## What Changed?

I've removed the complexity of multiple tiers. No more trying to figure out which plan you need—if you're serious about analytics, go Pro. If you're just getting started or running a smaller site, the Free plan has you covered.

All existing users have been migrated automatically. If you were on a different plan, you're now on the equivalent tier with the same or better limits.
