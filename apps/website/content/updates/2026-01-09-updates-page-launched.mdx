You're reading the first post on Bklit's new updates page! I've wanted a dedicated space to share what's happening with the project, and now it's here.

## What to Expect

I'll use this page to share:

- **Feature announcements** - When I ship something new
- **Engineering updates** - Technical improvements and infrastructure changes
- **Project milestones** - Growth, partnerships, and community highlights

All updates include a shareable link (click "Copy link" below any post) so you can easily reference specific announcements.

## Why Not a Blog?

This isn't a blog with long-form articles or tutorials. It's a changelog—quick, factual updates about what's changing in Bklit. If you want to stay current with the project, this is the place to check.

I'll keep posts concise and to the point. No fluff, just the facts about what's new and what's coming.

## Subscribe

For now, bookmark this page or check back periodically. I'm considering adding an RSS feed or email notifications in the future if there's interest. Let me know on Discord or GitHub if that would be useful.
