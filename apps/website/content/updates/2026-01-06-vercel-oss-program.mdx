I've submitted an application for Bklit to join the Vercel Open Source Software (OSS) Program. This program provides free Pro-tier Vercel hosting and resources for qualifying open-source projects.

## Why This Matters

Bklit is fully open-source and available for self-hosting, but I also run a hosted version at app.bklit.com for users who want a managed solution. Currently, I'm covering hosting costs out of pocket while the project grows.

If accepted into the Vercel OSS Program, I'll get:

- Free Pro-tier Vercel hosting for the dashboard and documentation
- Improved deployment infrastructure
- Better preview deployments for contributors
- More resources to allocate toward development instead of hosting costs

## What Happens Next?

Vercel reviews OSS applications on a case-by-case basis. I'll keep you updated on the status. Regardless of the outcome, Bklit will continue to be free and open-source with self-hosting as a first-class option.

If you're interested in supporting the project, the best way is to star the repository on GitHub, share it with others who might find it useful, or contribute code and feedback.
