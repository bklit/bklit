I've built a Raycast extension for Bklit and submitted it to the Raycast Store for review. Once approved, you'll be able to check your analytics directly from Raycast without opening the dashboard.

## Quick Stats at Your Fingertips

The extension provides commands to view your key metrics from the last 24 hours:

- Top 5 countries by traffic
- Mobile vs desktop breakdown
- Top 5 referrers
- Top 5 most-visited pages  
- Browser distribution

All data updates in real-time and uses your existing API tokens for authentication.

## API Endpoints

To power the extension, I've added dedicated Raycast API endpoints (`/api/raycast/*`) that return optimized data for the menu bar display. These endpoints are available to everyone, so if you want to build your own integrations, the API is documented and ready to use.

Once the extension is approved by Raycast, I'll share installation instructions. In the meantime, the API endpoints are live and working if you want to experiment with custom integrations.
