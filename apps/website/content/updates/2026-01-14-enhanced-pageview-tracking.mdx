We've upgraded pageview tracking to capture actual page titles and comprehensive metadata, plus enhanced campaign attribution for better marketing insights.

## What's New

### Real Page Titles

Previously, we inferred page titles from URLs (e.g., `/pricing` became "Pricing"). Now we capture the actual page title from your `<title>` tag, so "Bklit - Simple Analytics" shows exactly as you intended.

The Pageviews dashboard now groups by path and displays the most recent title, eliminating duplicates while showing the real content.

### SEO Metadata Capture

Every pageview now captures:

- Meta description
- Open Graph image
- Favicon
- Canonical URL
- Language settings
- Robots directives

This data sets us up for future features like SEO insights and social share previews.

### Enhanced Campaign Attribution

Marketing teams get better data with:

- **Click ID tracking**: Google Ads (gclid), Facebook (fbclid), Microsoft (msclkid), TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter
- **Referrer classification**: Automatic categorization as organic, social, paid, or referral
- **UTM ID support**: Track campaign IDs across platforms

This powers better ROI analysis and multi-touch attribution (coming soon).

## Migration Required

If you're self-hosting, run the ClickHouse migration:

```bash
cd apps/dashboard
./scripts/migrate-clickhouse-pageviews.sh
```

Cloud users: No action needed, we've already migrated your data.

## What's Next

This foundation enables upcoming features:

- Campaign performance dashboard
- SEO health monitoring
- Social share analytics
- Multi-touch attribution

Existing pageviews will show inferred titles until new traffic arrives with actual metadata. Your tracker script will automatically start capturing this data on your next deployment—no code changes needed.
