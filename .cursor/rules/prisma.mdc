When we need to fetch none-live data for our analytics app we should always use prisma to do so.

- Ensure that by default we are not caching data when the page is refreshed.
- Adhere to best practices and most up-to-date principals when building prisma queries.
- Whenever we need to fetch or perform a CRUD operation, we should create a file using kebab-case.ts naming conventions in /apps/dashboard/src/actions/ directory.
- Always check to see if an action already exists.
