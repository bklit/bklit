Always check to see if we have the available shadcn/ui component available in our components/ui directory.

If we dont have the required shadcn component use the cmd line to install.
`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add ...`

Under the hood shadcn/ui  components use radix primitives. We always have access to the default radix props with our shadcn components.
