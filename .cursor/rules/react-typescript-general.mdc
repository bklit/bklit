- we use hooks and lib directories to organise our code see examples: [use-mobile.ts](mdc:apps/dashboard/src/hooks/use-mobile.ts) and [utils.ts](mdc:apps/dashboard/src/lib/utils.ts) - always create reusable functions, hooks and lib files to keep our code scalable and maintainable where possible.
- adhere to best & modern typescript /react practices.
- when creating types use the interface method.
- avoid using too much client side code where possible.
- use a SSR, server component first approach, if components need to be client components then create a new component for it.
- organise our lib directory into sub folders when necessary - for example we use polar.sh for our payments and subscriptions, we should put any helpers and lib/hook functions into a polar sub directory.
- keep code organised
- keep comments to a minimum
- generally import components like so `import { Component } from ...`
